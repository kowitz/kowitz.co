    Hello, I’m Braden Kowitz.
    </p>

    <i class="em em-pencil2"></i>
    <p>
    I’m a designer who advises startups on how to build
    products that customers will love. I do this by teaching teams
    how to listen to customers, how to scale their design teams, how to
    build processes that support innovation, and how to create workplaces
    where great design can happen.
    </p>

    <p>
    I’m currently a design partner at <a href="http://gv.com/">GV</a>,
    a venture capital fund backed by Google. Through this role I’ve had the
    good fortune to work with many truly amazing startups:
    <a href="http://classpass.com">ClassPass</a>,
    <a href="http://gusto.com">Gusto</a>,
    <a href="http://slack.com">Slack,</a>
    <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a>,
    <a href="http://flatironhealth.com">Flatiron Health</a>,
    <a href="http://tunein.com">TuneIn</a>,
    <a href="http://bluebottlecoffee.com">Blue Bottle Coffee</a>,
    <a href="http://23andme.com">23andMe</a>,
    <a href="http://onemedical.com">One Medical Group</a>,
    <a href="http://hubspot.com">HubSpot</a>,
    <a href="http://retailmenot.com">RetailMeNot</a>,
    <a href="http://nest.com">Nest</a>,
    and many more.
    </p>

    <p>
    After working with so many teams, my colleagues and I decided to capture
    some of the lessons we’ve learned along the way. This project started as
    many <a href="https://library.gv.com/tagged/design">design articles</a>, and grew to become a
    New York Times best selling book:
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/150112174X/">Sprint: How to Solve
    Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days</a>.
    </p>

    <i class="em em-speech_balloon"></i>
    <p>
    In addition to writing, I also speak at design and startup conferences
    around the world. Recently I’ve been talking about
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoEtYLOtqig">Design Culture</a>
    (Slush, 2016), and how teams can create environments where designers
    are productive and happy. I also love talking about
    <a href="https://vimeo.com/188140190">Design Sprints</a>
    (Webdagene, 2016) and
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQl74ARR9RY">Failure</a>
    (Airbnb, 2012).
    </p>

    Before I began advising startups, I was an early designer at Google.
    I joined the company in 2005 and and led the design of several new
    products including
    <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/">Google for Business</a>,
    <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Spreadsheets</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a>.
    I also led <a href="https://www.google.com/gmail/about/">Gmail</a>
    design for several years before moving to GV.
    </p>

    <i class="em em-computer"></i>
    <p>
    I grew up in the Midwest and was pretty much always a nerd. I remember
    spending hours upon hours with my
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=TI99">first computer</a>.
    So it’s no surprise I ended up studying Computer Science at the
    <a href="http://cs.uiuc.edu">University of Illinois</a>.
    During my summers I built early virtual reality simulations at the
    <a href="https://beckman.illinois.edu">Beckman Institute</a> and interactive data visualizations at
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucent">Lucent Technologies</a>.
    </p>

    <i class="em em-heart_eyes"></i>
    <p>
    But as much as I enjoyed engineering, my true passion has always been making
    things for other people. So I decided to move into the field of design
    by attending the <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">Human-Computer Interaction</a> graduate program at
    Carnegie Mellon. It’s been a fantastic journey ever since.
    </p>

    <p>
    If I’m not thinking about design, I’m probably thinking about
    backpacking. My favorite trips have been to
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BLlyEybB2WM/">Iceland</a>,
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/qrNrNxwFoz/">Rae Lakes</a>,
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BF-IvsUwFtm/">Desolation Wilderness</a>,
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_7cuN0wFku/">Cone Peak</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BLaV1jwh_KH/">the Minarets</a>.
    This world is too amazing not to explore!
